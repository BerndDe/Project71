    <p class="p">Outdoor learning is an important part of the EYFS curriculum at Twickenham Prep where our Nature Trail is used to extend and enhance the outdoor learning provision. The children have the freedom to explore and experience the outdoors using multiple senses.
      In discovering where creatures live, making potions, creating stories, building dens and using simple tools, the children learn to respect the environment and grow in confidence. Weekly sessions are delivered by our Forest School Leader following the Forest School principles of child-led learning that use the outdoors as an inspirational, educational environment. 
      As the weeks go by the childrenâ€™s self-esteem visibly grows as they learn new skills and with this comes resilience, awareness of the needs of others, and independence.</p>
